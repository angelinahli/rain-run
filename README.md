# Rain Run

Simple Java game allowing user to control a character using keyboard input, where the user must make quick decisions to navigate a terrain.

## To Do
* Edit the graphics of the main character and the monsters to look nicer.
* Create a main menu to start the game from.
* When a game has ended, insert a button they can press to return to the main menu.
* Create a rules panel explaining the rules of the game, to link from the main menu.
* Figure out how to toggle between different panels based on buttons.
* [Optional] Include a pause button, such that the user can manually pause the game when they want.
* [Optional] Allow the user to choose what color their character should be, and/or different themes.
* [Optional] Include "themes" / "levels" in our game, where periodically the background / monster colors change.

## Rules

1. You control the character at the bottom using the left/right or A/D keys.
2. Avoid the falling monsters in blue.
3. Catch different powerups to gain special advantages! 
4. Over time the monsters will start to get bigger and the game will start to move faster.
